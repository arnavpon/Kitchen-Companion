//  Class representing a single ingredient in a recipe
//  The output of a recipe is an Ingredient itself, since outputs can be used to build larger meals
//  In fact, when you think about it, any "meal" that we view as the combination of a variety of dishes can be seen as a SINGLE meal made up of several constituent RECIPES/INGREDIENTS that are combined together. This abstraction can help with planning the preparation order.
